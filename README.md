Cruise Ships Project

Demonstrate use of object oriented programming and the interaction of objects to allow cruise ships to operate.

Ship, Port and Itinerary are objects

TDD used to develop programme

Test files include dummies, stubs and spies 

More than 2 ports need to be created to insert into the itinerary on instantiation of the ship.

The ship will move from its initial port to each port in the itinerary as it sets sail and docks.
